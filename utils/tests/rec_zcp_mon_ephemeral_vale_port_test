# Test objective: check if a zero-copy monitor is correctly blocked until the
#                 monitored ephemeral VALE port reads the frame.
# Operations:
# 0) restart fd_server to have a clean starting state
# 1) connect two ephemeral VALE ports (v0, v1) to the same VALE switch.
# 2) open a zero-copy monitor v0/z for v0.
# 3) send from v1 without receiving from v0, check that v0/z doesn't receive the
#    rame.
# 4) receive from v0, check that v0/z receives the frame.
