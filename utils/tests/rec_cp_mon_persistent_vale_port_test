# Test objective: check if a receive copy monitor receives frames when its
#                 monitored persistent VALE port is receiving, even if the
#                 monitored port hasn't yet read the frame.
# Operations:
# 0) restart fd_server to have a clean starting state
# 1) create a persistent VALE port (v0).
# 2) connect v0 and a VALE ephimeral port (v1) to the same VALE switch.
# 3) open a receiving copy monitor vo/r for v0.
# 4) send from v1 and don't read from v0, check that v0/r receives the frame.
# 5) receive from v0.
