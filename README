    	Netmap - a framework for fast packet I/O
    VALE -  a Virtual Local Ethernet using the netmap API
===================================================================

NETMAP is a framework for very fast packet I/O from userspace.
VALE implements an equally fast software switch using the netmap API.
Both can deal with line rate on real or emulated 10 Gbit ports.

In this directory you can find source code (BSD-Copyright)
for FreeBSD and Linux. Note that recent FreeBSD distributions
already include both NETMAP and VALE.

Installation instructions 
-------------------------
A kernel module (netmap.ko or netmap_lin.ko) implements the whole
VALE switch and the core NETMAP routines.
Netmap-aware device drivers are needed to use netmap on ethernet ports.
To date, we have support for Intel ixgbe (10G), e1000/e1000e/igb (1G),
Realtek 8169 (1G) and Nvidia (1G).

  FreeBSD
  --------
  (FreeBSD HEAD and stable/9 already include netmap in the source tree
  so you should not need the code in this distribution.)
  + add 'device netmap' to your kernel config file and rebuild a kernel.
    This will include the netmap module and netmap support in the device
    drivers.  Alternatively, you can build standalone modules
    (netmap, ixgbe, em, lem, re, igb)

  Linux
  -------
  + make sure you have kernel sources matching your installed kernel,
    so the build system can patch the sources and build netmap-enabled
    drivers. If kernel sources are in /a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ , then you should do

	cd netmap/LINUX
	make KSRC=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/		# builds the kernel modules
	make KSRC=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ apps	# builds sample applications

    You can omit KSRC if your kernel sources are in a standard place.
  

Applications
-------------
The directory examples/ contains some programs that use the netmap API

    pkt-gen	a packet generator/receiver working at line rate at 10Gbit/s
    bridge	a utility that bridges two interfaces or one interface
		with the host stack
    pcap.c	a simple libpcap-over-netmap library, and some test
		code, to help porting pcap applications to netmap.
		The library compiles as libnetmap.so, you can use it
		to replace your libpcap.so.* 

Testing
-------
pkt-gen is a generic test program which can act as a sender or receiver.
It has a large number of options, but the simplest form is:

    pkt-gen -i ix0 -f rx	# receive and print stats
    pkt-gen -i ix0 -f tx -l 60	# send a stream of 60-byte packets

(replace ix0 with the name of the interface or VALE port).
This should be able to work at line rate (up to 14.88 Mpps on 10
Gbit/interfaces, even higher on VALE) but note the following

CAVEATS
-------
Before reporting slow send or receive speed on a physical interface,
check ALL of the following:

  + make sure the interface is up before invoking pkt-gen
  + make sure that the netmap module and drivers are correctly
    loaded and can allocate all the memory they need (check into
    /var/log/messages or equivalent)

    	These errors will generally cause a failure to register
	the netmap port

  + some switches/interfaces take a long time to (re)negotiate
    the link after starting pkt-gen; in case, use the -w N option
    to increase the initial delay to N seconds;

    	This may cause inability to transmit, or lost packets for
	the first few seconds of transmission

  + make sure that the interface and switch you connect to has
    flow control (FC) disabled (either via sysctl or ethtool).

        If FC is enabled and the receiving end is unable to cope
	with the traffic, the driver will try to slow down transmission,
	sometimes to very low rates.

  + a lot of hardware is not able to sustain line rate. For instance,
    ixgbe has problems with receiving frames that are not multiple
    of 64 bytes (with/without CRC depending on the driver); also on
    transmissions, ixgbe tops at about 12.5 Mpps unless the driver
    prefetches tx descriptors. igb does line rate in all configurations.
    e1000/e1000e vary between 1.15 and 1.32 Mpps. re/r8169 is
    extremely slow in sending (max 4-500 Kpps)
