 * For each "interface" (NIC, host stack, PIPE, VALE switch port) bound to
 * a file descriptor, the mmap()ed region contains a (logically readonly)
 * struct netmap_if pointing to struct netmap_ring's.
 *
 * There is one netmap_ring per physical NIC ring, plus one tx/rx ring
 * pair attached to the host stack (this pair is unused for non-NIC ports).
 *
 * All physical/host stack ports share the same memory region,
 * so that zero-copy can be implemented between them.
 * VALE switch ports instead have separate memory regions.
 *
 * The netmap_ring is the userspace-visible replica of the NIC ring.
 * Each slot has the index of a buffer (MTU-sized and residing in the
 * mmapped region), its length and some flags. An extra 64-bit pointer
 * is provided for user-supplied buffers in the tx path.
 *
 * In user space, the buffer address is computed as
 *	(char *)ring + buf_ofs + index * NETMAP_BUF_SIZE
 *
 * Added in NETMAP_API 11:
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can request the allocation of extra spare buffers from
 *   the same memory pool. The desired number of buffers must be in
 *   nr_arg3. The ioctl may return fewer buffers, depending on memory
 *   availability. nr_arg3 will return the actual value, and, once
 *   mapped, nifp->ni_bufs_head will be the index of the first buffer.
 *
 *   The buffers are linked to each other using the first uint32_t
 *   as the index. On close, ni_bufs_head must point to the list of
 *   buffers to be released.
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can request space for extra rings (and buffers)
 *   allocated in the same memory space. The number of extra rings
 *   is in nr_arg1, and is advisory. This is a no-op on NICs where
 *   the size of the memory space is fixed.
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can attach to PIPE rings sharing the same memory
 *   space with a parent device. The ifname indicates the parent device,
 *   which must already exist. Flags in nr_flags indicate if we want to
 *   bind the master or slave side, the index (from nr_ringid)
 *   is just a cookie and does not need to be sequential.
 *
 * + NIOCREGIF can also attach to 'monitor' rings that replicate
 *   the content of specific rings, also from the same memory space.
 *
 *   Extra flags in nr_flags support the above functions.
 *   Application libraries may use the following naming scheme:
 *	netmap:foo			all NIC ring pairs
 *	netmap:foo^			only host ring pair
 *	netmap:foo+			all NIC ring + host ring pairs
 *	netmap:foo-k			the k-th NIC ring pair
 *	netmap:foo{k			PIPE ring pair k, master side
 *	netmap:foo}k			PIPE ring pair k, slave side
 *
 * Some notes about host rings:
 *
 * + The RX host ring is used to store those packets that the host network
 *   stack is trying to transmit through a NIC queue, but only if that queue
 *   is currently in netmap mode. Netmap will not intercept host stack mbufs
 *   designated to NIC queues that are not in netmap mode. As a consequence,
 *   registering a netmap port with netmap:foo^ is not enough to intercept
 *   mbufs in the RX host ring; the netmap port should be registered with
 *   netmap:foo*, or another registration should be done to open at least a
 *   NIC TX queue in netmap mode.
 *
 * + Netmap is not currently able to deal with intercepted trasmit mbufs which
 *   require offloadings like TSO, UFO, checksumming offloadings, etc. It is
 *   responsibility of the user to disable those offloadings (e.g. using
 *   ifconfig on FreeBSD or ethtool -K on Linux) for an interface that is being
 *   used in netmap mode. If the offloadings are not disabled, GSO and/or
 *   unchecksummed packets may be dropped immediately or end up in the host RX
 *   ring, and will be dropped as soon as the packet reaches another netmap
 *   adapter.

 *
 *	nr_name	(in)
 *		The name of the port (em0, valeXXX:YYY, eth0{pn1 etc.)
 *
 *	nr_version (in/out)
 *		Must match NETMAP_API as used in the kernel, error otherwise.
 *		Always returns the desired value on output.
 *
 *	nr_reqtype (in)
 *		One of the NETMAP_REQ_* command types below
 *
 *	nr_body (in)
 *		Pointer to a command-specific struct, described by one
 *		of the struct nmreq_xyz below.
 *
 *	nr_options (in)
 *		Command specific options, if any.
 *
 * A NETMAP_REQ_REGISTER command activates netmap mode on the netmap
 * port (e.g. physical interface) specified by nmreq_header.nr_name.
 * The request body (struct nmreq_register) has several arguments to
 * specify how the port is to be registered.
 *
 *	nr_tx_slots, nr_tx_slots, nr_tx_rings, nr_rx_rings (in/out)
 *		On input, non-zero values may be used to reconfigure the port
 *		according to the requested values, but this is not guaranteed.
 *		On output the actual values in use are reported.
 *
 *	nr_mode (in)
 *		Indicate what set of rings must be bound to the netmap
 *		device (e.g. all NIC rings, host rings only, NIC and
 *		host rings, ...). Values are in NR_REG_*.
 *
 *	nr_ringid (in)
 *		If nr_mode == NR_REG_ONE_NIC (only a single couple of TX/RX
 *		rings), indicate which NIC TX and/or RX ring is to be bound
 *		(0..nr_*x_rings-1).
 *
 *	nr_flags (in)
 *		Indicate special options for how to open the port.
 *
 *		NR_NO_TX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() push
 *			packets on tx rings only if POLLOUT is set.
 *			The default is to push any pending packet.
 *
 *		NR_DO_RX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() release
 *			packets on rx rings also when POLLIN is NOT set.
 *			The default is to touch the rx ring only with POLLIN.
 *			Note that this is the opposite of TX because it
 *			reflects the common usage.
 *
 *		Other options are NR_MONITOR_TX, NR_MONITOR_RX, NR_ZCOPY_MON,
 *		NR_EXCLUSIVE, NR_RX_RINGS_ONLY, NR_TX_RINGS_ONLY and
 *		NR_ACCEPT_VNET_HDR.
 *
 *	nr_mem_id (in/out)
 *		The identity of the memory region used.
 *		On input, 0 means the system decides autonomously,
 *		other values may try to select a specific region.
 *		On return the actual value is reported.
 *		Region '1' is the global allocator, normally shared
 *		by all interfaces. Other values are private regions.
 *		If two ports the same region zero-copy is possible.
