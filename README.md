# Netmap: a framework for fast packet I/O

## Introduction

Netmap is a an framework for very fast packet I/O from userspace.
VALE is an equally fast in-kernel L2 software switch using the netmap API.
Both are implemented as a single kernel module for FreeBSD and Linux.
Netmap/VALE can handle tens of millions of packets per second, matching
the speed of 10G and 40G ports even with minimum sized frames.

To learn about netmap, you can use the following resources:

* the man pages (https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=netmap&sektion=4 or
`share/man/man4/netmap.4` in this repository)
* the [papers](#references).
* the tutorials, available at https://github.com/netmap-unipi/netmap-tutorial

This repository contains source code (BSD-Copyright) for FreeBSD, Linux and
Windows.
Netmap, VALE and related applications are already included in FreeBSD
since version 10.x. FreeBSD users should use the code included in the
FreeBSD src tree rather than the one in this repository, although the two
codebases are mostly aligned.

## Why should I use netmap?

Netmap is mostly useful for userspace applications that must deal with raw
packets: traffic generators, sinks, monitors, loggers, software switches
and routers, generic middleboxes, interconnection of virtual machines.

The `apps/` directory includes `pkt-gen.c` (a fast traffic generator/receiver)
and `bridge.c`, a simple bidirectional interconnect between two ports.
The kernel module itself implements a learning ethernet bridge.

More resources are hosted on other repositories. For example
https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap-libpcap contains a netmap-enabled version
of libpcap (which is also included in FreeBSD distribution) so you can run
any libpcap client on top of netmap at much higher speeds than using bpf.
The https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap-ipfw repository contains
a userspace version of ipfw and dummynet which can handle several
million packets per second in a single thread

QEMU has native netmap support, so it can interconnect VMs at high speed
through netmap ports (e.g., using VALE ports or netmap pipes).
For maximum performance, it is also possible to pass-through any netmap port
into a QEMU VM, as described [here](README.ptnetmap.md).
Also the FreeBSD bhyve hypervisor has native support for netmap.

Netmap alone **does not** accelerate your TCP. For that you need to implement
your own tcp/ip stack probably using some of the techniques indicated
below to reduce the processing costs.

## Architecture

netmap uses a number of techniques to establish a fast and efficient path
between applications and the network. In order of importance:

* I/O batching
* efficient device drivers
* pre-allocated tx/rx buffers
* memory mapped buffers

Despite the name, memory mapping is NOT the key feature for netmap's
speed; systems that do not apply all these techniques do not achieve
the same speed _and_ efficiency.

Netmap clients use a select()-able file descriptor to synchronize
with the network card/software switch, and exchange multiple packets
per system call through device-independent memory mapped buffers and
descriptors. Device drivers are completely in the kernel, and the system
does not rely on IOMMU or other special mechanisms.


## Installation instructions

A single kernel module implements the core Netmap functions, including
the VALE switch and access to physical NICS using unmodified device drivers
(at the price of much lower performance than netmap-aware drivers).

Netmap-aware device drivers are needed to use netmap at high speed
on ethernet ports.  To date, we have support for Intel ixgbe (10G),
ixl (10/40G), e1000/e1000e/igb (1G), Realtek 8169 (1G) and Nvidia (1G).
FreeBSD has also native netmap support in the Chelsio 10/40G cards.

### FreeBSD
FreeBSD already includes netmap kernel support by
default since version 11.
If your kernel configuration does not include netmap, you can enable it
by adding a `dev netmap` line, and rebuilding the kernel.
Alternatively, you can build standalone modules (netmap, ixgbe, em, lem,
re, igb, ...).

FreeBSD users will find the netmap example applications
in `src/tools/tools/netmap/` within the FreeBSD src tree.


### Linux

The `./configure && make` build system in the LINUX/
directory will let you patch device driver sources and build
some netmap-enabled device drivers.
Please look [here](LINUX/README.md) for more instructions.

Make sure you have kernel headers matching your installed kernel and
the `zip` package installed (e.g., `sudo apt install zip`).
The sources for e1000e, igb, ixgbe and i40e will be downloaded
from the Intel e1000 project on sourceforce.
If you need the netmap enabled drivers for e1000, veth, forcedeth,
virtio-net or r8169 you will also need the full kernel sources.

Linux users can find the netmap example applications in the `apps/`
directory in this repository.

#### Step 1

Configure netmap. To compile Netmap/VALE and the Intel drivers above:

	./configure

(This will also download the Intel driver sources from sourceforce).
To compile only Netmap/VALE (using unmodified drivers):

	./configure --no-drivers # only netmap, no unmodified drivers

If you need the full kernel sources and you have installed them in
/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/, then you should do

	./configure --kernel-dir=/a/b/c/linux-A.B.C/ # netmap+device drivers

You can omit --kernel-dir if your kernel sources are in a standard place.

If you use distribution packages, full sources and headers  may be in
different places contain headers (e.g., on debian systems). Use

	./configure --kernel-sources=/a/b/c/linux-sources-A.B/ --kernel-dir=/a/b/c/linux-headers-A.B/

#### Step 2

Build kernel modules and sample applications:

	make

#### Step 3

Install the new modules and the applications:

	sudo make install

To have the new netmap-enabled driver modules alongside the original
ones, you may want to add `--driver-suffix=-netmap` to the configure
command above. The new drivers will then be called `e1000e-netmap`,
`ixgbe-netmap`, and so on.

### Windows

Netmap has been ported to Windows in summer 2015 by Alessio Faina as part of
his Master thesis. You may take a look [here](WINDOWS/README.txt) for details,
but please be aware that the port has been left behind for years, and is
currently unmantained.

## Applications

The directory `apps/` contains some programs that use the netmap API

* `pkt-gen.c`	a packet generator/receiver working at line rate at 10Gbit/s
* `vale-ctl.c`	utility to configure ports of a VALE switch
* `bridge.c`	a utility that bridges two interfaces or one interface
		with the host stack

For libpcap and other applications look at the extra/ directory.

## Testing

`pkt-gen` is a generic test program which can act as a sender or receiver.
It has a large number of options, but the simplest form is:

    pkt-gen -i ix0 -f rx	# receive and print stats
    pkt-gen -i ix0 -f tx -l 60	# send a stream of 60-byte packets

(replace ix0 with the name of the interface or VALE port).
This should be able to work at line rate (up to 14.88 Mpps on 10
Gbit/interfaces, even higher on VALE) but note the following

## Operating Speed

Netmap is able to send packets at very high rates, and for simple
packet transmission and reception, speed generally not limited by
the CPU but by other factors (link speed, bus or NIC hw limitations).

For a physical link, the maximum number of packets per second can
be computed with the formula:

	pps = line_rate / (672 + 8 * pkt_size)

where "line_rate" is the nominal link rate (e.g 10 Gbit/s) and
pkt_size is the actual packet size including MAC headers and CRC.
The following table summarizes some results (in Mpps)

			LINE RATE
    pkt_size 	100M	1G	10G	40G

          64	.1488	1.488	14.88	59.52
         128	.0589	0.589	 5.89	23.58
         256	.0367	0.367	 3.67	14.70
         512	.0209	0.209	 2.09	 8.38
        1024	.0113	0.113	 1.13	 4.51
        1518	.0078	0.078	 0.78	 3.12

On VALE ports, there is no physical link and the throughput is
limited by CPU or memory depending on the packet size.

## Common problems

Before reporting slow send or receive speed on a physical interface,
check ALL of the following:

### Cannot set the device in netmap mode:
* make sure that the netmap module and drivers are correctly
    loaded and can allocate all the memory they need (check into
    /var/log/messages or equivalent)
* check permissions on `/dev/netmap`
* make sure the interface is up before invoking `pkt-gen`

### Sender does not transmit
* some switches/interfaces take a long time to (re)negotiate
the link after starting `pkt-gen`; in case, use the -w N option
to increase the initial delay to N seconds;

This may cause inability to transmit, or lost packets for
the first few seconds of transmission

### Receiver does not receive
* make sure traffic uses a broadcast MAC addresses, or the UNICAST
address of the receiving interface, or the receiving interface is in
promiscuous mode (this must be done with ifconfig; `pkt-gen` does not
change the operating mode)

### Lower speed than line rate
* check that your CPUs are running at the maximum clock rate
and are not throttled down by the governor/powerd.
On Linux:

	lscpu # shows current cpu speed
	sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils

* make sure that the sender/receiver interfaces and switch have
flow control (FC) disabled (either via sysctl or ethtool).
If FC is enabled and the receiving end is unable to cope
with the traffic, the driver will try to slow down transmission,
sometimes to very low rates.

* a lot of hardware is not able to sustain line rate. For instance,
ixgbe has problems with receiving frames that are not multiple
of 64 bytes (with/without CRC depending on the driver); also on
transmissions, ixgbe tops at about 12.5 Mpps unless the driver
prefetches tx descriptors. igb does line rate in all configurations.
e1000/e1000e vary between 1.15 and 1.32 Mpps. re/r8169 is
extremely slow in sending (max 4-500 Kpps)

### Host rings do not work

* disable NIC offloads, because netmap does not support them and
packets exchanged between netmap and the kernel stack can be dropped
because of invalid checksums. On FreeBSD offloads can be disabled with
a command like

	sudo ifconfig vtnet0 -txcsum -rxcsum -tso4 -tso6 -lro -txcsum6 -rxcsum6

Check [here](LINUX/README.md) for the corresponding Linux command.
